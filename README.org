* LEARNING ELISP
This repository is created to track the long learning curve of
learning elisp (Emacs Lisp).

Lisp (List Processing)is a family of languages that differs that from
the C family. It extensively uses parenthesis and lists to write
programs. In fact, elisp is all lists. At this point of writing, elisp
still seems like a very strange language but I am starting to see the
glimpse of its beauty and elegance.
